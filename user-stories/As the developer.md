✅ I should remove unwanted default Breeze endpoints and markup
~~So that unwanted functionality is not present~~

✅ I should re-brand the interface
~~So it reflects a community portal rather than Laravel scaffolding~~

✅ Implement Laravel Sail
~~So I can benefit from extra services without polluting my OS~~
