✅ I should remove unwanted default Breeze endpoints and markup
👍 So that unwanted functionality is not present

✅ Implement Laravel Sail
👍  So I can benefit from extra services without polluting my OS

I need to achieve very high test coverage
So I know the code works

✅ I should re-brand the interface
👍 So it reflects a community portal rather than Laravel scaffolding

✅ I must put CSRF protection back on when I've finalised the form submission process for Stripe
👍 So it's safer

✅ I need to sort out the menu highlighting
👍 So that is works correctly for nested routes
